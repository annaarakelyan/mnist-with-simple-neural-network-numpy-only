# mnist-with-simple-neural-network-numpy-only

This is a demnostration of buidling a simple neural network with three layers
usign only numpy only and then training and testing mnist benchmark data 
we were able to achieve 97% accuracy with this simple neural network on mnist data
This shows power of simple neural network over sophisticated machine learning algorithms. 
huge thanks to Joseph Redmon for providing mnist data in csv format
